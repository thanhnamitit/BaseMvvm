/**
 * https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36421930/connectivitymanager-connectivity-action-deprecated
 * Sometimes I think it makes more sense worry about the future in the future.
 * This is purely a pragmatic approach to programming.
 * Of course, you can always try to make sure that your code doesn't use any deprecated features.
 * On the other hand, deprecated features usually stay around for a long time and it may be that your app will be end-of-lifed before the deprecated features go away.
 * Android N is so new that I wouldn't spend a lot of time worrying about it. Yet. Just my 2 cents.
 * Please note that I wrote a comment to the question and didn't suggest that "don't do that" was a valid answer.
